In this mini-project I create a wonderful calculator that can do basic math operations. It can also return percentage of one number and raising numbers to the Power of One.

The calculator appearance is like that there is a "History Board" on the top encompassing three lines each representing one operation done before, a "Mirror Board" at the middle that displays whatever operation is going on, and finally the main body of the app that encompasses all the buttons. 

There are two other buttons called "backspace" and "clear" giving a great functionality to my application. The first one clear (pop) the last character in the operation string, whether it's an operand or operator. The second button clear all the operation string, so you can see the "Mirror Board" is empty.

I add keyboard support to it but not the whole keybord keys, just "Numpad" keys, backspace, enter, and Escape. So you won't see a great functionality with keyboard input unless your keyboard has got a "Numpad".

I do this as a part of The Odin Project course. I really really appreciate those guys who made TOP! I hope they're are doing well, and I wish you enjoy my work.
